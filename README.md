# SmartGrip
SmartGrip is an intelligent exercise bar that leverages AI and Machine Learning to analyze and enhance your training sessions. Equipped with force sensor strips, it can:

- **Classify Exercises**: Automatically detect and classify pull-ups, chin-ups, dead hangs, and more based on force patterns.
- **Count Repetitions**: Precisely track the number of reps performed for each exercise type.
- **Monitor Form**: Identify grip irregularities and uneven force distribution to ensure proper form and minimize injury risks.
- **Track Progress**: Summarize key metrics like total hang time, rep counts, and exercise balance, all accessible via a mobile app.
- **Visualize Results**: View your workout data with intuitive charts and graphs to track progress over time.

With SmartGrip, you can achieve smarter, safer, and more efficient workouts while keeping your fitness journey organized and motivating.
